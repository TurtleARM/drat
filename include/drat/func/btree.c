/**
 * Get the latest version of an object, up to a given XID, from an object map
 * B-tree that uses Physical OIDs to refer to its child nodes.
 * 
 * root_node:   A pointer to the root node of an object map B-tree that uses
 *      Physical OIDs to refer to its child nodes.
 *      It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that `root_node` satisfies
 *      these criteria; if it does not, behaviour is undefined.
 * 
 * oid:         The Virtual OID of the object to search for in the object map
 *      B-tree whose root node is `root_node`. That is, the result returned will
 *      pertain to an object found in the object map that has the specified OID.
 * 
 * max_xid:     The highest XID to consider for the given OID. That is, the
 *      result returned will pertain to the single object found in the object
 *      map that has the given OID, and also whose XID is the highest among all
 *      objects in the object map that have the same OID but whose XIDs do not
 *      exceed `max_xid`. To consider all XIDs (that is, to just return the
 *      object with the highest XID among those objects with the specified OID),
 *      you can specify `~0` or `-1`.
 * 
 * RETURN VALUE:
 *      A pointer to an object map entry (key/value pair) corresponding to the
 *      unique object whose OID and XID satisfy the criteria described above for
 *      the parameters `oid` and `max_xid`. If no such entry exists, a NULL
 *      pointer is returned. The key-part is included so that the caller see
 *      the XID of the returned entry.
 *      This pointer must be freed when it is no longer needed.
